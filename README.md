# Basics of Python – Notebook

This repo contains a self-contained Jupyter notebook covering **Python basics**:
variables & types, operators, strings, collections, control flow, loops, functions, and comprehensions.  
It also includes a tiny mini‑project (simple stats utility).

## Files
- `python-basics-assignment.ipynb` — Executed notebook with outputs, ready to render on GitHub.

## Quick View (on GitHub)
GitHub will render the `.ipynb` directly in the browser.

## Run Locally
1. Install Python 3.10+
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install Jupyter
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```
4. Launch Jupyter
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Open `python-basics-assignment.ipynb` and run all cells (Kernel → Restart & Run All).

## Run in JupyterLite (No Install)
You can also upload the notebook to a JupyterLite site (e.g., your course environment) and run it in the browser.

## Notes
- The notebook is designed to be **portable** (no heavy dependencies). It only uses the Python standard library.
- Screenshots for peer review can be taken from the executed notebook view, per your course instructions.
